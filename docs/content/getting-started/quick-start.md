Add `Admob` node to your main scene and populate the ID fields of the node

- Debug IDs will only be used when your Godot app is run in debug mode
- Real IDs will only be used when the `is_real` field of the node is set to `true`

There is also a [demo](https://github.com/godot-sdk-integrations/godot-admob/tree/main/demo) which can help you get started quickly.
